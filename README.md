# Why Computer Science?
First assignment of AP Computer Science Principles

## Explaination
The reason I chose this infographic to answer the question "Why Computer Science" was because it showed the wide applicability of the field in day-to-day lives of even those whose jobs are, at the surface level, concerned with a vastly different subject matter. As the diagram states, "7.7 million Americans say they use computers in complex ways at their jobs," and the majority of these people aren't in STEM-oriented fields. This large number demonstrates the broad reach of computer science in our increasingly technological world, showing us that even in seemingly disparate domains, the use of computing is becoming more and more prevalent. Thus, having at least basic knowledge of computer science will be very beneficial for the jobs of today, and perhaps a requisite for the jobs of the future.
